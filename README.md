## What is the Collatz Conjecture?
It's a mathematical problem that has not been solved yet.
It follows the following two rules:

* When a number is even: divide it by 2.
* When a number is odd: multiply it by 3 and add 1.

After an x amount steps the number 1 will be the result, that's where we stop our program. However, we are not sure whether this is the case for every possible number.
